## Ideas

At first I did not have much of a game idea, but now I am thinking of a learning adventure.

Level 1 -  The turtle will be my main character.  The turtle will live start in a water world.  There will be several NPC characters in the world that will help the turtle solve CompSci problems until he is able to leave the world.  There will be a second player, fish that you can compete against.

Interaction will require proximety and will stop game from time/destruction.  There will need to be input support for game intractions and game results.  Results will be stored in local storage and there will be a time based leaderboard.  Solve a problem from the NPC and you can leave the world, level 1 will be game over.

NPC's include...

1. GitHub Character.  The NPC will ask questions about clone, pull, push, rebase, etc.
2. Linux Character.  The Penguin will ask questions about mkdir, cd, ls, rm, running scripts, etc
3. Jupyter Notebook Character.  We ask you questions about kernelspec, magic commands, markdown, and Toggle Developer Tools.
4. JavaScript Character - This will ask questions related to Variable names, Data Types ie JSON Objects, Operators, boolean expressions, conditional statements, iteration, functions, procedures, class definitions, etc.
